These are the platforms on which gopher is known to work.

Gopher should also work on any Unix/Posix platform (Solaris, SunOS, *BSD,
Linux, MacOS X, etc).  Please let us know if you have troubles compiling or
running gopher on your platform by e-mailing gopher@complete.org.

Thanks!

If you want to use gopher on older platforms (VMS, Ultrix, etc), please
check out the UMN gopher 2.3.1 distribution.  Gopher 3 is not currently
supporting VMS, though we have not removed the VMS support from the tree. 
(VMS hackers: help us out!)
