gopher (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial re-release.  Package had been yanked after 1995 due to licensing.
  * UMN has just GPL'd gopher.
  * This package contains the security fix from bugtraq.
  * I have patched it to chroot() and setuid() earlier for better
    security.
    SIDE EFFECT: logging will not work if chroot() is used.
  * The extension chopping code was buggy, so I have removed it.
  * Made many fixes to eliminate compiler warnings and errors.
  * Removed redefinitions of sys_errlist
  * Included more header files to bring in relevant prototypes
  * Modified to use Debian paths
  * Modified configure.in to look for -lcrypt
  * Modified Makefile.config.in to use -Wall
  * Removed -DSETPROCTITLE from configure.in to make start-stop-daemon
    work better.
  * Added logrotate
  * Wrote Debian support from scratch.
  * AUTH.h includes crypt.h
  * gopherd/Makefile.in uses separate conffile dir (Debian path)
  * STRstring.h had a paren problem; gcc on alpha brought it out.  Fixed.
  * String.h was missing some header files.
  * Other fixes.

	* gopherd/Makefile (install): Fixed syntax error in the
	installation of gopherdlocal.conf.

	* gopher/CURcurses.h: Changed inclusion of curses.h to inclusion
	of "ncurses/curses.h".  Hopefully this will solve strange problems
	with terminal features.
